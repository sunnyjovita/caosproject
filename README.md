# Chat application using socket programming and multi-threading concept

For our Computer Architecture and Operating System course, we made a chat application using the concept of multi-threading and socket programming in Python. 
We implemented multi-threading concept to get and receive data/messages concurrently from both client and server sides as sender and receiver. 
With the core concept that we use which is multi-threading and socket programming method, both client and server can communicate by typing messages from their sockets.
One socket listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket (client) reaches out to other to form a connection.

## Chat application using socket programming and multi-threading concept
For our Computer Architecture and Operating System course, we made a chat application using the concept of multi-threading and socket programming in Python. We implemented multi-threading concept to get and receive data/messages concurrently from both client and server sides as sender and receiver.

## Installation
For the installation, please follow the guide.
1. Clone the repository. Make sure you have both client.py and server.py
2. To run it, you need to have python as interpreter in your machine
3. To run the program, you need to run the *server.py* first, followed by the *client.py*
4. Running either file has to be from a different terminal
5. You can send messages as both connection has been established
