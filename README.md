# Chat application using socket programming and multi-threading concept

For our Computer Architecture and Operating System course, we made a chat application using the concept of multi-threading and socket programming in Python. 
We implemented multi-threading concept to get and receive data/messages concurrently from both client and server sides as sender and receiver. 
With the core concept that we use which is multi-threading and socket programming method, both client and server can communicate by typing messages from their sockets.
One socket listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket (client) reaches out to other to form a connection.
